## Ideas

- We need a testing apparatus. Create a list of atomic features or attributes that can be tested. Each location's merit can be calculated by testing each feature.
- An exhaustive approach is out of the question; we need some kind of algorithm
- Google can provide some ideas, maybe one of us can try to find an existin algorithm while the other one creates some kind of AI that will choose locations with a search method and then the algorithm will be able to choose the best location using the heuristics we made previously

## Notes

- The map data is importable from the OpenStreetMap website, through a python API.
